# Handwritten Digit Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Classification project! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately classify handwritten digits. The goal is to build a robust model that can recognize and differentiate between digits (0-9) based on input images.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset used for training and testing the model is the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of digits in the dataset.
   - Visualized sample images to gain insights into the characteristics of the handwritten digits.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Normalized pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 for improved model convergence.
   - Flattened the 28x28 images into a 1D array for input to machine learning models.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented machine learning models for digit classification. Common models include:
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
     - Random Forest
   - Experimented with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Trained the chosen model on the training dataset.
   - Utilized techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized confusion matrices to understand how well the model is performing for each digit.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Discussed deployment strategies for integrating the trained model into real-world applications.
   - Provided guidance on model deployment for developers interested in implementing digit classification functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arijit258/handwritten-digit-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd handwritten-digit-classification
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
